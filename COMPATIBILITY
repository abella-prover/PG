Running on macOS
-------------------

We recommend 24.5+ builds of GNU Emacs, which builds natively on
macOS.  Binaries are available at various websites (e.g.,
http://emacsformacosx.com), or you can build your own by compiling
from the FSF CVS. See the Emacs Wiki at
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS for more.

Note that macOS compatibility isn't thoroughly tested.  If you discover
problems, please send a report and/or fix to the PG tracker.  Please
add tips to the wiki page above.


Running on Windows
------------------

Note that Windows compatibility isn't tested by the maintainers.
